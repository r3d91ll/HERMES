# Anthropology Source Acquisition Strategy

## The Challenge

Classic anthropology texts that demonstrate the 70-year measurement struggle are:
- In books, not papers
- Behind academic paywalls
- Often 300+ pages
- Not on ArXiv or open repositories

## Practical Solutions

### 1. Open Access Sources

**Internet Archive (archive.org)**
- Many older anthropology texts (pre-1970s)
- Bateson's "Steps to an Ecology of Mind" (1972)
- Some Lévi-Strauss translations
- Out-of-copyright ethnographies

**Google Scholar**
- PDF links for some papers
- Citations show influence
- "All versions" sometimes finds open copies

**Academia.edu / ResearchGate**
- Anthropologists often share their papers
- More recent work (1990s-2020s)
- Request full text from authors

**HAU: Journal of Ethnographic Theory**
- Open access anthropology journal
- Recent debates on method and theory

### 2. Key Excerpts Strategy

Instead of full books, focus on:
- Book reviews in journals (summarize arguments)
- "Introduction" and "Conclusion" chapters
- Handbook/companion entries on semantic analysis
- Encyclopedia entries on meaning in anthropology

### 3. Secondary Sources That Summarize

**Annual Reviews**
- Annual Review of Anthropology
- Often have "state of the field" articles
- Show evolution of debates over time

**Handbooks**
- Handbook of Sociocultural Anthropology
- Companion to Linguistic Anthropology
- These summarize decades of debate

### 4. Strategic Paper Selection

**Focus on Papers That:**
1. Review the history of semantic analysis in anthropology
2. Critique formal methods (componential analysis, ethnosemantics)
3. Discuss the "crisis of representation"
4. Attempt computational/digital methods

**Example Searches:**
- "limits of componential analysis anthropology"
- "crisis of representation ethnography"
- "formal methods critique anthropology"
- "measuring meaning cultural anthropology"

### 5. Bridge Literature (More Accessible)

**Information Science Side**
- Papers on "cultural heritage informatics"
- "Digital humanities" + anthropology
- "Computational social science" + culture
- These are more likely to be open access

**Recent Computational Work**
- "Computational ethnography" papers
- "Cultural analytics" research
- "Digital anthropology" methods
- Often on ArXiv or conference proceedings

### 6. Creating the Evidence Base

**Minimum Viable Evidence:**
1. 5-10 papers showing anthropology's measurement frustration
2. 5-10 papers showing failed formal methods
3. 5-10 recent papers using embeddings/NLP for culture
4. Key quotes from major theorists (even if from secondary sources)

**Quote Mining Strategy:**
- Find review articles that quote Geertz, Lévi-Strauss, etc.
- Use Google Books preview for key passages
- Citation context from Google Scholar
- Book reviews often contain key quotes

### 7. Legal Free Sources

**Project Gutenberg**
- Early anthropology (pre-1928)
- Classic ethnographies

**PLOS ONE**
- Open access interdisciplinary work
- Some computational anthropology

**Semantic Scholar**
- Better for finding connections
- Shows citation context

### 8. The Book Problem

For essential books like Geertz's "Interpretation of Cultures":
- University library access (if available)
- Google Books preview (limited pages)
- Reviews and summaries in journals
- Citation analysis showing influence

## Practical Next Steps

1. **Start with Open Access**
   - HAU journal archives
   - Internet Archive texts
   - Recent computational work

2. **Mine Reviews and Summaries**
   - Annual Review of Anthropology
   - Handbook chapters
   - Encyclopedia entries

3. **Focus on Quotes**
   - Collect key statements about measurement problem
   - Even secondary sources citing primary texts
   - Build quote database showing frustration

4. **Document the Gap**
   - Papers trying formal methods (1960s-1980s)
   - Papers giving up on measurement (1980s-2000s)
   - Papers discovering computational methods (2010s+)

This approach builds sufficient evidence without needing full academic database access.
